Attendance Face Recognition System

📌 Overview
The Attendance Face Recognition System is an AI-powered application that automates attendance tracking using facial recognition technology. This system leverages deep learning models to detect and recognize faces, ensuring an efficient and secure method of maintaining attendance records.

🚀 Features
✅ Face detection and recognition using OpenCV & deep learning
✅ Automated attendance marking in real-time
✅ Secure and efficient data storage
✅ User-friendly interface for managing attendance records
✅ Supports multiple users and scalability

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python (for backend processing)
OpenCV (for image processing)
TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning-based face recognition)
Flask/Django (for web interface, if applicable)
SQLite/MySQL (for storing attendance records)

📷 How It Works
Capture images of registered users and store them in the dataset folder.
Train the facial recognition model using deep learning techniques.
The system detects and recognizes faces in real-time via a webcam.
Attendance is marked automatically and stored in the database.
🔍 Future Improvements
Improve accuracy using a larger dataset
Implement cloud storage for attendance records
Add support for mobile application integration
